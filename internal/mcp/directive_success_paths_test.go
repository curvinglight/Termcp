// the bytes reach the channel and the Enter does not.
//
// It was never exercised. Every test of `input` drove a refusal (a closed pipe, a
// foreign session, a missing payload), so the directive's success path had no
// coverage at all — and the difference it exists for is exactly what a refusal test
// cannot see. `run` submits; `input` leaves the line unfinished.
//
// A pipe running `cat` makes both halves observable: cat copies what it reads to the
// channel, so the bytes appear, while the NEWLINE that would end the line only
// arrives with `key enter`.
