// TestADirectoryHintNamesAFlagThatExists pins issue #146.
//
// `read <session> file <dir>` is refused correctly, but the refusal pointed at
// `--action stat` — a flag of the `file` directive, which the command-surface
// rewrite deleted. `--action` is not accepted anywhere now, so the hint sent the
// caller straight into a second error:
//
//	read s file /tmp
//	  -> 400  /tmp: is a directory; use --action stat to list its contents
//	read s file /tmp --action stat
//	  -> 400  unknown flag for read: --action
//
// The message is the only thing a caller has to go on, so it has to name a
// spelling this build actually answers. `--op stat` does (verified below by
// running it), and the shell can list a directory too — which the hint says, so
// a caller without a session-scoped file read still has a way forward.
