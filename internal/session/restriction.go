// Restriction trims what may act on a session, across every surface that can
// act on one: the MCP tools, the REST endpoints, and the WebSocket the browser
// terminal speaks. It is the mechanism behind extensions: an extension is an
// ordinary session whose capabilities were narrowed at creation time, so a
// handle handed to an agent can only do what the extension's author decided —
// and nothing the author did not list is silently reachable.
//
// The allow list holds CAPABILITY ids ("shell.input", "file.read"), not tool
// names. A tool name is one surface's spelling of an operation; the capability
// is the operation, so a template that grants "file.read" grants it on the MCP
// tool, the REST route and the WebSocket alike without the author naming three
// things. internal/capability owns the name → id mapping in both directions.
//
// Enforcing it on one transport only would make the whitelist a matter of which
// door the caller picked, so each surface asks these same questions rather than
// restating the rule. internal/mcp's guard and internal/webui's REST and
// WebSocket refusals are thin wrappers over Allows/AllowsPath.
//
// Both halves are whitelists and the zero value means unrestricted: an ordinary
// session carries a Restriction{} and every operation behaves exactly as before.
// Building one through NewRestriction is the only supported route, because path
// patterns must be validated once, at extension-load time, rather than failing
// mid-conversation on a pattern nobody has looked at.

// resolve is kept as written and matches only that exact string. The reason is
// compatibility, not leniency: extensions saved before the switch hold tool
// names, and a manifest on disk outlives the process that wrote it. Allows
// translates a tool name onto its capability id, so those templates keep
// granting exactly what they always granted.
