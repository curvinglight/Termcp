// TestTwoPersistsCannotInterleave pins the lock around persistOne.
//
// persistOne takes its snapshot at the top and writes it at the bottom, with the shell
// manifests in between (an fsync each, measured ~7ms). Two concurrent persists are
// therefore a read-modify-write race whose loser is the NEWER state: a persist that
// started before a session died can finish after the one that recorded why it died, and
// the manifest on disk goes back to the older copy with the reason gone.
//
// That is not a test-only race. `get` after a restart is where a user asks why their
// session disappeared (issue #176), and the answer was being overwritten — observed as
// `TestWhyASessionDiedIsRecordedAndSurvivesARestart` failing on CI with the reason live
// in memory and empty on disk, about once in sixty runs, reproduced locally at -cpu=1.
//
// THE WINDOW IS HELD OPEN RATHER THAN RACED FOR. Forty iterations of the real
// interleaving still passed with the lock removed (measured), so the test drives the hook
// inside persistOne instead: the first persist stops between snapshot and write, and the
// second must not get in. Without the lock it walks straight through and the assertion
// fires.
